Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industryâ€™s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br /><hr />

A lorem ipsum generator is ideal for a web developer looking for a dummy tool with advanced features. It is available in different languages like English, Spanish, Chinese, German, and Ukrainian.<br />

The software generates up to 20 paragraphs and a maximum of 4500 words. It fills typographical texts for the webmaster. The overview feature makes it possible to preview how the content will display on a page.

The tools allow you to download dummy text in either HTML or plain text. It is compatible with website CMS like WordPress, Joomla, Magento, and Drupal. Besides, you can use it with Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and editors like Sublime and Notepad++.
